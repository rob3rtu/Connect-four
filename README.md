# Connect-four

Connect Four game made using MiniMax Algorithm. 

Because of the large number of posible moves, the algorithm's tree height is set to 3. 
The full algo would require a tree of height 7^42, wich is a very very large number.

*Important*
Because of the height = 3, the algorithm can be easily beaten!
